        "This tutorial demonstrates how to use two transfer learning strategies—_feature extraction_ and _fine-tuning_—for applying pre-trained representations to a downstream task, such as image classification. You will classify images of cats and dogs by using pre-trained models from [TensorFlow Hub](https://tfhub.dev).\n",
        "\n",
        "Transfer learning consists of taking features learned on one task, and leveraging them on a new, similar task. A pre-trained model is a saved network that was previously trained model on a typically large dataset for a particular task, such as image classification. You can use the pre-trained model on an as is basis or customize it to a given task.\n",
        "\n",
        "Customizing a pre-trained model with transfer learning can be done in two ways:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. _Feature extraction_: Use the representations learned by a previous pre-trained model to extract meaningful features from new samples. That is, you repurpose the feature maps previously learned from the dataset the pre-trained model trained on. During feature extraction, you train only the last (few) layer(s).\n",
        "\n",
        "  For image classification, you add a new classifier, such as a new fully-connected layer (`tf.keras.layer.Dense`), on top of the base (pre-trained) model. You freeze the base model's layers, and then train only the final output layer. The base (pre-trained) model will already contain the features that can be useful for your particular task. (The final part of the original base model is specific to the original task, and subsequently specific to the set of classes on which the model was trained.)\n",
        "\n",
        "1. _Fine-tuning_: Use the weights/parameters of the base pre-trained model to initialize the training on a new task, unfreeze a few of the top layers, and jointly train both the newly-added layer(s) (similar to feature extraction), and the unfrozen layers of the base model. This method allows to fine-tune the higher-order feature representations in the base model to make them more relevant for the specific task. Fine-tuning is also known to reduce training resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "The notebook's workflow for classification with pre-trained models is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Load the data and build an input pipeline.\n",
        "1. Load a pre-trained base model.\n",
        "1. Apply a pre-trained model on sample data without any training (weight updates) to test the model.\n",
        "1. Perform classification using transfer learning: \n",
        "  - Perform feature extraction by training only the classification layer.\n",
        "  - Perform fine-tuning by updating the weights of parts of the pre-trained network."

As you go higher up, the features are increasingly more specific to the dataset on which the model was trained. The goal of fine-tuning is to adapt these specialized features to work with the new dataset, rather than overwrite the generic learning."

        "* **Using a pre-trained model for feature extraction**: When working with a small dataset, it is a common practice to take advantage of features learned by a model trained on a larger dataset in the same domain. This is done by instantiating the pre-trained model and adding a fully-connected classifier on top. The pre-trained model is frozen and only the weights of the classifier get updated during training. In this scenario, the convolutional base extracts all the features associated with each image, and you train only the classifier that determines the image class given the set of extracted features.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Fine-tuning a pre-trained model**: To further improve performance, you can repurpose the top-level layers of the pre-trained models to the new dataset via fine-tuning. In this case, you tune your weights such that your model learns high-level features specific to the dataset. This technique is usually recommended when the training dataset is large and very similar to the original dataset that the pre-trained model was originally trained on.\n",
