## Class `Monitor`





Defined in [`tensorflow/contrib/distribute/python/monitor.py`](https://www.github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.11/tensorflow/contrib/distribute/python/monitor.py).

Executes training steps, recovers and checkpoints.

Note that this class is particularly preliminary, experimental, and
expected to change.

    session=None
)
```

* <b>`session`</b>: a `Session` instance that's needed for graph mode.


#### Raises:

* <b>`ValueError`</b>: if `session` was provided for eager mode or not provided for
    graph mode.
