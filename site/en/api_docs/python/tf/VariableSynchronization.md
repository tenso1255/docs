# tf.VariableSynchronization

## Class `VariableSynchronization`





Defined in [`tensorflow/python/ops/variables.py`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r1.12/tensorflow/python/ops/variables.py).

Indicates when a distributed variable will be synced.

* `AUTO`: Indicates that the synchronization will be determined by the current
  `DistributionStrategy` (eg. With `MirroredStrategy` this would be
  `ON_WRITE`).
* `NONE`: Indicates that there will only be one copy of the variable, so
  there is no need to sync.
* `ON_WRITE`: Indicates that the variable will be updated across devices
  every time it is written.
* `ON_READ`: Indicates that the variable will be aggregated across devices
  when it is read (eg. when checkpointing or when evaluating an op that uses
  the variable).
