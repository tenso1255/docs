# tf.layers.Dropout

## Class `Dropout`

Applies Dropout to the input.

Inherits From: [`Dropout`](../../tf/keras/layers/Dropout), [`Layer`](../../tf/layers/Layer)

### Aliases:

* Class `tf.compat.v1.layers.Dropout`
* Class `tf.layers.Dropout`



Defined in [`python/layers/core.py`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/r1.14/tensorflow/python/layers/core.py).

<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

Dropout consists in randomly setting a fraction `rate` of input units to 0
at each update during training time, which helps prevent overfitting.
The units that are kept are scaled by `1 / (1 - rate)`, so that their
sum is unchanged at training time and inference time.

#### Arguments:


* <b>`rate`</b>: The dropout rate, between 0 and 1. E.g. `rate=0.1` would drop out
  10% of input units.
* <b>`noise_shape`</b>: 1D tensor of type `int32` representing the shape of the
  binary dropout mask that will be multiplied with the input.
  For instance, if your inputs have shape
  `(batch_size, timesteps, features)`, and you want the dropout mask
  to be the same for all timesteps, you can use
  `noise_shape=[batch_size, 1, features]`.
* <b>`seed`</b>: A Python integer. Used to create random seeds. See
  <a href="../../tf/random/set_random_seed"><code>tf.compat.v1.set_random_seed</code></a>.
  for behavior.
* <b>`name`</b>: The name of the layer (string).
